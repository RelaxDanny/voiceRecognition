# voiceRecognition
This is a voice recognition program to open web browsers with a simple speech like "google, youtube, facebook, and etc".

# Installation
1. $ pip install SpeechRecognition

2. $ pip install PyAudio

# If Error Occurrs:
I have struggled some error for three hours. 

First: "PyAudio not installed" -> this errors occurs when you are using python 3.7 or higher. 

PyAudio only works until Python 3.6!

Second: You might not be able to download pip install PyAudio in Mac OS sometimes, and I do not know exactly why. 
However, you can fix the installation problem by downloading the portaudio using homebrew.

The command is :
$ brew install portaudio

I recommend you to download Homebrew before you clone this source codes.
